        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>As a person born in the mid 1980s I have seen technology grow and evolve in ways that people in the past could only imagine in science fiction stories. From watching my father read programming tips in News Rooms on the UseNet in the 80's, to learning to navigate the Internet with a dial-up modem in the 90's, to watching social media become the norm in the early 2000's, all the way up to now where smart tech lives in everyone's pockets. Although I've been witness to these changes over the years, I've never learned to participate, to contribute, to help expand that technology. For years, I felt as if I didn't have the skills to learn how to become an active member of the tech community. That is, until I learned about <span class="epic"><a href="https://www.epicodus.com">Epicodus!</a></span> After a some research, I decided that I do actually have not only the skills, but the smarts, the motivation, and commitment to learn how to become a programmer and development. And I look forward to sharing this journey with you all, one that I hope will not end any time soon!</p>

        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>While new to the world of programming and coding, I have certainly worn many hats. Currently I earn a living by working at a local grocery store here in Portland. But that's not the career I am changing, it's simply a job to fit with my <span class="epic">Epicodus</span> schedule. The career I'm actually switching from is as a Mail Carrier (aka <i>a Mail Man</i>) for the United States Postal Service. While it certainly is a good job and one with it's numerous high points, I had to realize that not only was it not the right environment for me, but also not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. While I'm no genius, I do feel that I have creative potential, and I wanted to pursue a craft where I could use my intellect a launching pad for my creativity. I carried mail for five years, and I don't regret a day of it, but I am very pleased with my decision to make a change.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Before the post office, however, I worked a variety of different jobs. Going in reverse order, my work history has been:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Meat Clerk at <a href="https://www.newseasonsmarket.com/our-departments/meat/">New Seasons Market</a></li>
          <li>Mail Carrier for the <a href="https://www.usps.com/">USPS</a></li>
          <li>Venue Security and Guest Services at the <a href="https://www.aladdin-theater.com/">Aladdin Theatre</a></li>
          <li>Lead Bicycle Mechanic for <a href="https://publicbikes.com/">Public Bikes</a> in San Francisco, CA</li>
          <li>Supervisor and Record Buyer for <a href="https://streetlightrecords.com/">Streetlight Records</a> in Santa Cruz, CA</li>
        </ol>
