        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>As a person born in the mid 1980s I have seen technology grow and evolve in ways that people in the past could only imagine in science fiction stories. From watching my father read programming tips in News Rooms on the UseNet in the 80's, to learning to navigate the Internet with a dial-up modem in the 90's, to watching social media become the norm in the early 2000's, all the way up to now where smart tech lives in everyone's pockets. Although I've ben witness to these changes over the years, I've never learned to participate, to contribute, to help expand that technology. For years, I felt as if I didn't have the skills to learn how to become an active member of the tech community. That is, until I learned about <a href="https://www.epicodus.com">Epicodus!</a> After a some research, I decided that I do actually have not only the skills, but the smarts, the motivation, and commitment to learn how to become a programmer and development. And I look forward to sharing this journey with you all, one that I hope will not end any time soon!</p>
