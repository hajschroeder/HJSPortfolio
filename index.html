        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>As a person born in the mid 1980s I have seen technology grow and evolve in ways that people in the past could only imagine in science fiction stories. From watching my father read programming tips in News Rooms on the UseNet in the 80's, to learning to navigate the Internet with a dial-up modem in the 90's, to watching social media become the norm in the early 2000's, all the way up to now where smart tech lives in everyone's pockets. Although I've been witness to these changes over the years, I've never learned to participate, to contribute, to help expand that technology. For years, I felt as if I didn't have the skills to learn how to become an active member of the tech community. That is, until I learned about <span class="epic"><a href="https://www.epicodus.com">Epicodus!</a></span> After a some research, I decided that I do actually have not only the skills, but the smarts, the motivation, and commitment to learn how to become a programmer and development. And I look forward to sharing this journey with you all, one that I hope will not end any time soon!</p>

        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>While new to the world of programming and coding, I have certainly worn many hats. Currently I earn a living by working at a local grocery store here in Portland. But that's not the career I am changing, it's simply a job to fit with my <span class="epic">Epicodus</span> schedule. The career I'm actually switching from is as a Mail Carrier (aka <i>a Mail Man</i>) for the United States Postal Service. While it certainly is a good job and one with it's numerous high points, I had to realize that not only was it not the right environment for me, but also not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. While I'm no genius, I do feel that I have creative potential, and I wanted to pursue a craft where I could use my intellect a launching pad for my creativity. I carried mail for five years, and I don't regret a day of it, but I am very pleased with my decision to make a change.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Before the post office, however, I worked a variety of different jobs. Going in reverse order, my work history has been:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Meat Clerk at <a href="https://www.newseasonsmarket.com/our-departments/meat/">New Seasons Market</a></li>
          <li>Mail Carrier for the <a href="https://www.usps.com/">USPS</a></li>
          <li>Venue Security and Guest Services at the <a href="https://www.aladdin-theater.com/">Aladdin Theatre</a></li>
          <li>Lead Bicycle Mechanic for <a href="https://publicbikes.com/">Public Bikes</a> in San Francisco, CA</li>
          <li>Supervisor and Record Buyer for <a href="https://streetlightrecords.com/">Streetlight Records</a> in Santa Cruz, CA</li>

            <h2>What I've Done</h2>
            <p>In the brief amount of time I've been with at <span class="epic">Epicodus</span> I've already built some cool projects. Here's some of what I've worked on</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A webpage that images the Shire from Lord of the Rings as <a href="https://github.com/hajschroeder/epicSunday0109">a vacation resort!</a> The purpose of this page was to gain practice and experience with CSS stylings. Additionally, it was the first time throughout the course that my partner and I had written and styled a README</li>
              <li>A webpage for a <a href="https://github.com/hajschroeder/epicMon0110">very rude cupcake shop.</a> This was how my partner and I learned about using divs and spans!</li>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/hajschroeder/funWithRepos">An empty repository that was used to test my GitBash.</a> Spoiler alert, it did not work, but I eventually learned why not.</li>
              <li>An <a href="https://github.com/hajschroeder/animal-shelter">animal shelter</a>. It was with this project that my partner and I learned more about making colums as well as working with the box model.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h2>My Goals</h2>
            <p>Beyond simply completing the full stack course at <span class="epic">Epicodus</span>, I have further goals in mind that I'd like to work towards</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A portfolio with personal projects that I've built outside of <span class="epic">Epicodus</span></li>
              <li>Gain a certain level of proficiency with Python and C#, even though I am in the Ruby/React stack</li>
              <li>Make time for myself during this bootcamp. Remember to practice good habits</li>
              <li>Learn to recognize when I'm experiencing burn out or Impostor Syndrome, and learn to tools to cope with (what I'm told) are very common mental traps in the coding world</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>More Than a Coder. More Than A Student</h2>
        <p>While right now my work with <span class="epic">Epicodus</span> is my top priority, I think its important to still enjoy the things that I love, and remember that my personality is not defined by the work I do. Some things that I enjoy when I'm not working or learning:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Reading</em>. I enjoy all sorts of books, but I am quite fond of Science Fiction and Fantasy. The more high concept, the better</li>
          <li><em>Music.</em> I love music. I have been a trumpet player since i was 10 years old, and I've dabbled in many other instruments over the years, including the mandolin. While I enjoy a wide variety of music, I lately have been listening to a lot of very droning and ambient variety of Metal called Doom (don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds)</li>
          <li><em>Table Top Role Playing Games.</em> Even if you're not familiar with this term, you're probably familiar with the concept. Perhaps the most famous TTRPG is Dungeons and Dragons, a fantasy based role playing game in which the players collaboratively tell a story while taking turns at executing combats and solving puzzles. My preferred system is called Pathfinder, but there are literally hundreds if not thousands of other TTRPG systems in the world.</li>
          <li>Most important, <em>my wife, Erin.</em> I met Erin just over six years ago, and we were married in the summer of 2019. She is a wonderful person, and is nothing but kind and supportive. She is truly an inspiration, and is the person who gave me the strength I needed to pursue this positive change in my life.</li>
          <li>Oh, and then there's Ophelia, our cat.</li>
